	<h2>In this project we made the game tetris.We created a game board with a different variety of shapes falling down, and as they fall down the goal is to maneuver the shapes to make them fit within one another. As the game goes on, the shapes start stacking on top of eachother and have to be smart with where you put which shapes and the direction of them. When you are placing shapes, when a full horizontal line is created with shapes, it is taken away and you earn points. The game is over when the shapes get stacked too high and go above the game board. </h2>
